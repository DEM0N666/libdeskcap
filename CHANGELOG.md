v0.5.1 (16 Aug 2014)
--------------------

Bug fixes:
- Prevent crashing many common applications (Mostly web browsers and video players) by blacklisting them from being hooked.
- Stopped spamming the log file with "cannot execute command" messages if a helper process is not running.
- Attempted stability fix by disabling "clean" unhooking. This may cause some applications to no longer be capturable.
